# 🧠 Digital Circuit Simulator (Python)

A Python-based simulator to model and visualize digital logic circuits. This tool supports simulation of:

- Basic Logic Gates: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NAND`, `NOR`, `XOR`
- Full Adder Circuit
- 4-bit Array Adder for binary addition
- Evaluation of Boolean expressions

This simulator is ideal for students, educators, and hobbyists looking to explore digital logic design and Boolean algebra.
